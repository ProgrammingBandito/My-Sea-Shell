# My-Sea-Shell

The code enclosed is my custom C shell for UNIX systems.

It runs from BASH and can do the following task:

-cd

-pwd

-echo

-sleep

-EOF and SIGINT redirect

Use Notes:

The makefile is for building an executable from the following files:

-cshellurs.c

-shellfunctions.c

-shellheader.h

To run the shell, go the the folder where the executable 'runthis.out' is located and type: ./runthis.out

Thank you for your time,
D
